# Survey Analysis 

Survey results of remote workers from the Australian state of New South Wales, taken in  2020 which aimed to capture the shift in remote work experiences and attitudes during different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and gain insights on its long term implications.

 *Data source
 This dataset was obtained from an open source site named Kaggle [Link](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Ahv3dnbknyfmgnzvKJMTD9NUoEAa?e=QdujRa)*
 
## Suggested Analysis 
* How has the COVID pandemic impacted the amount of work done remotely? What can be expected post-pandemic?
* Does working remotely positively impact productivity? Are there any other benefits?
* What are the biggest barriers to overcome if remote work becomes the norm in the future?

### Data Cleaning and Manipulation 
Data cleaning and manipulation are crucial steps in the data analysis process. They involve preparing and transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis.This is the dataset after i cleaned it [Link](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Ahv3dnbknyfmgn5DCM-vliVRqJQ4?e=F6yGmz)
 
 I put together the work percentages from "remote work during COVID" and "post-COVID remote work preference." I categorized 0%-25% as "Very low," 26%-50% as "Low," 51%-75% as "Medium," and 75%-100% as "High." I did this to simplify the analysis for myself modified certain column names in this dataset to enhance their presentation.

#### ANALYSIS


Quantitative analysis was limited in this project due to the scarcity of numeric values, making it primarily a qualitative analysis centered on textual data.
Looking at my dashboard's "Remote Work During COVID" chart, it seems not many people were working remotely, possibly because it was a new concept. In the "Post-COVID Remote Work Preference" section, most people prefer working from home. The overall impact of remote work appears positive, but 400 people feel neutral about it, and I'm not sure why. They might have had prior experience with remote work before COVID.

I also looked into the problems faced during the remote work.I kept this dashboard simple on purpose. I wanted to avoid adding too much information and complexity. I've highlighted a few key points to demonstrate my skills, and I'm eager to learn and get even better.
